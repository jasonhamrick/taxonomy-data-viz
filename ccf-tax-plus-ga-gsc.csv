Every day should include going to school, hanging with friends, playing video games, etc. This was not the case for me. For me, age 11 included being diagnosed with a chronic illness that would impact my life in a variety of ways. My doctor told me I had Crohn’s disease. I knew something was wrong, but I had no idea exactly what it was. After my diagnosis, my parents sat down and tried to explain to me what was ahead, but the reality was that we had no clue about what the future was going to be like.","556","3507","","0","Brian's Story","13","","0","Breadcrumb","10","","0","","","","","","","","","","","","0","","","","","","","","","","9.471","Fri, 07 Feb 2020 00:31:30 GMT","","","","","16","00:02:37","","","","","","https://www.crohnscolitisfoundation.org/brians-story"
